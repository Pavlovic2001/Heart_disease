# Heart_disease
This project analyzes heart disease data from two clinical sources: Cleveland Clinic Foundation and University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed using Python, complemented by data management and querying in PostgreSQL with SQL. Machine learning techniques were applied to identify the most important features for heart disease diagnosis. The final interactive dashboard, developed in Power BI, provides insights into patient demographics, clinical indicators, and comparisons between patients with and without heart disease.
